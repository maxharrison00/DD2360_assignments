# Assignment 4: Programming Productivity

- Assignment Group 3
- Giovanni Prete and Max Harrison

Both had equal contributions.

## Question 1 -  1D Convolution

## Question 2 - NVIDIA Libraries and Managed Memory

### 1)

Run the program with different dimX values. For each one, explain how you can approximate the FLOPS (floating-point operation per second) achieved in computing the SMPV (sparse matrix multiplication). Report FLOPS achieved by your code at different input sizes.

### 2)

Run the program with dimX=1024 and vary nsteps from 100 to 10000. Plot the relative error of the approximation at different nstep. Describe and explain your observations?

### 3)

Compare the performance with and without the prefetching in Unified Memory. How is the performance impact? [Optional: using nvprof or ncu to get UM related metrics]
