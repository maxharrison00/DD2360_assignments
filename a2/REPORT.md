Both had equal contributions.

# Question 1 - Shared Memory and Atomics

Describe all optimizations you attempted, and whether they improved or hurt performance. 
Which optimizations did you choose in the end and why? 
How many global memory reads and writes are performed in total in one run? Explain your answer.
How many atomic operations are performed in total in one run? Explain your answer.
How much shared memory is used in your code? Explain your answer.
How would the value distribution of the input array affect the collision and contention among threads? For instance, what contentions would you expect for the two options of value distributions?
For each array length of 1024, 10240, 102400, 1024000, plot the histogram generated by your code in a bar chart, where x-axis represents bins and y-axis represents counts. Specify thread block and grid. You will include results from the two value distributions.
For an input array of 1024 elements, profile and report Shared Memory Configuration Size and Achieved Occupancy. Describe one optimization that you would like to try.

# Question 2 - Reduction

Describe all optimizations you attempted, and whether they improved or hurt performance. 
Which optimizations did you choose in the end and why? 
How many global memory reads and writes are performed in total in one run? Explain your answer.
Do you use atomic operations? If so, how many atomic operations are performed in total? Explain your answer.
Do you use atomic operations? If so, how much shared memory is used in your code? Explain your answer.
Run your program on array lengths starting from 512 and increasing at x2 rate for 8-10 runs. Plot a bar chart to visualize the time taken by CPU and GPU for each run.
Do you observe any speed from using GPU? Why or why not?
Using the largest array size in 6, profile and report Shared Memory Configuration Size and Achieved Occupancy. Describe one optimization that you would like to try.

# Question 3 - Tiled Matrix Multiplication

How many global memory reads are performed by the tiled_gemm() kernel?  Compare it with that of the gemm() version.
Run with your program with a matrix A of (1024x1024) and B of (1024x1024), select 3 tile sizes for testing. Include the screenshot of your output. Explain the results.
Run with your program with a matrix A of (513x8192) and B of (8192x1023), select 3 tile sizes for testing. Include the screenshot of your output. Explain the results.
Profile your program in 2 and 3. Report Achieved Occupancy and Shared Memory usage.
Run your program with 8-10 different matrix sizes that increases from small size to larger sizes. Plot a bar chart comparing the runtime of the CPU version, the gemm(), and the three tiled gemm() kernels of these problems. Explain your results.
